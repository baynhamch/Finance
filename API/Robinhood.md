# Robinhood Trading API (1.0.0)

## Introduction
Welcome to Robinhood Crypto API documentation for traders and developers! The APIs let you view crypto market data, access your account information, and place crypto orders programmatically.

Interested in using our API? Get started with creating your keys on the Crypto Account Settings Page, available only on a desktop web browser.

Your use of the Robinhood Crypto API is subject to the Robinhood Crypto Customer Agreement as well as all other terms and disclosures made available on Robinhood Crypto's about page.

## Getting Started
Developing your own application to place trades with your Robinhood account is quick and simple. Start here with the code you'll need to access the API, authenticate credentials, and make supported API calls. These are essentially the building blocks of code for each API call, which you can easily build on based on your preferred strategies.

1. Create a script file
```
mkdir robinhood-api-trading && cd robinhood-api-trading
touch robinhood_api_trading.py
```

2. Install PyNaCl library
 ```
 pip install pynacl
 ```
