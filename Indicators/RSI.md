## **How RSI Works**
The RSI compares the strength of a security‚Äôs **up days** to its **down days** over a specified period (default **14 periods**). This comparison helps traders determine whether a security is gaining or losing momentum.

### **RSI Formula**
#### **Step 1: Basic RSI Calculation**
\[
RSI = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + \frac{\text{Average Gain}}{\text{Average Loss}}} \right)
\]

- **Average Gain** = Sum of gains over past 14 periods / 14
- **Average Loss** = Sum of losses over past 14 periods / 14

#### **Step 2: Smoothed RSI Calculation**
Once the **initial 14-period RSI** is calculated, a **smoothed version** is used for accuracy:
\[
RSI = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + \frac{(\text{Previous Average Gain} \times 13) + \text{Current Gain}}{(\text{Previous Average Loss} \times 13) + \text{Current Loss}}} \right)
\]
